# Programs to illustrate a performance issue with hash maps

These programs were written to illustrate the issue
presented in a blog post.  They are not intended to be
real benchmarks:  They don't make a serious effort to
warm up the virtual machines, or take an average over
several runs.  However they illustrate a quadratic
algorithm.
